Hi There!
This is my first C-Program "Hello, World" in the ALX SE program.
In this project, I will be looking at the C program, how to write a program that prints "Hello, World.
I will also look at the different processes of compiling a C-program, which includes. 
The Preprocessor
The Compiler
The Assembling
The Linking. 

Alright guys, wish me luck.

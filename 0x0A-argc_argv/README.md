To be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/DBgGt1BaQ75AkikI88WbEw), without the help of Google the following:

General
How to use arguments passed to your program
What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
